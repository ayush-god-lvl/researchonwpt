                <h2><span class="section-number">2.</span>Introduction & Problem Statement</h2>
                
                <h3><span class="section-number">2.1</span>Background</h3>
                <p>Traditional methods of electrical power transmission heavily rely on physical wires and direct electrical contacts. This dependency often leads to several drawbacks, including inconvenience (tangled cables, limited mobility), potential safety hazards (exposed wires, electrocution risks), and restricted device usage to areas with accessible power outlets.</p>

                <h3><span class="section-number">2.2</span>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The limitations of wired power transmission create significant challenges in modern electronic device usage. Wireless Power Transfer technology offers a compelling solution by eliminating these physical constraints, thereby enabling safer, more convenient, and significantly more flexible energy transfer across various applications and environments.</p>

                <h3><span class="section-number">2.3</span>Solution Approach</h3>
                <p>This project addresses these challenges by implementing a wireless power transfer system based on electromagnetic induction, creatively packaged in an Arc Reactor-inspired design that demonstrates the feasibility and potential of contactless energy transmission.</p>

                <h2><span class="section-number">3.</span>Theory & Fundamental Concepts</h2>
                
                <h3><span class="section-number">3.1</span>Electromagnetic Induction</h3>
                <p>The core principle governing this project is electromagnetic induction, described by Faraday's Law of Induction. This law states that a changing magnetic field through a coil of wire will induce an electromotive force (EMF), or voltage, in that coil.</p>

                <div class="equation">
                    ε = -N × (dΦ/dt)
                    <div class="figure-caption">Faraday's Law: ε = induced EMF, N = number of turns, dΦ/dt = rate of change of magnetic flux</div>
                </div>

                <h3><span class="section-number">3.2</span>Historical Context</h3>
                <p>The concept of wireless energy transmission was famously explored by Nikola Tesla in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly with his work on Tesla coils demonstrating resonant inductive coupling. Tesla envisioned a world powered wirelessly, which forms the conceptual foundation for modern WPT applications.</p>

                <h3><span class="section-number">3.3</span>Modern Applications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wireless Charging Pads:</strong> Smartphones, smartwatches (Qi standard)</li>
                    <li><strong>Electric Vehicles:</strong> Stationary and dynamic charging systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Implants:</strong> Powering devices without invasive battery replacement</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial Applications:</strong> Powering sensors in harsh environments</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><span class="section-number">3.4</span>Project Implementation</h3>
                <p>Our project leverages electromagnetic induction through two main components: a transmitter coil (primary) and a receiver coil (secondary). The transmitter creates an oscillating magnetic field by rapidly switching DC current, which induces voltage in the receiver coil according to Faraday's Law.</p>
